So VSCode is an electron app. Which means it basically runs an entire browser to run the frontend and node apis.
Which does actually provide a nice programming enviornment since you can access node apis from a chrome dev console, but your also running essentially a browser just o edit some text files on your computer

So if you say have Slack, Discord, VSCode, AND chrome open that's already 4 browsers. If you havn't heard browsers are kind of memory hogs. It's best to limit your system to one browser when you can.

Why is this important? Well if you have a 8-core cpu with 32gb of ram then you probably can run as many browsers as you want. I'm still on my 2015 Macbook pro with a dual-core cpu and 8gb of ram. I gotta make the most of what I have. It's being enviornmentally consious about my ram usage (and why do we need more and more powerful computers to do the same thing we did yesterday?)

So enter code-server!

Which basically takes the front end of VSCode and runs it in a browser and connects to a backend server for filesystem access! Since electron is basically a browser with a node it 

I had to move to sublime text in order to maintain good responsivness while typing. 


As I'm typing this in code-server I'm experiencing a lot of the same issues I had with the desktop app version. Maybe vscode just needs a quad-core cpu to really function well ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
